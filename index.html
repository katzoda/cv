            <h2>Hello.</h2>
            <p class="intro">During my last working experiences I found out that I always looked for the chance to do some coding.
                Although it wasn't an official part of my job I found something about the work or task where I could use programming.
                I liked it more than the main task. It was when I worked as a clerc or admin in the warehouse where I wrote scripts in VBA
                for myself to automate stuff. Or when I worked as a network engineer where I wrote scripts in Python.
                Again for myself and this time it was usefull for my colleagues as well.

                <h3 class="skill-row-h3">JavaScript</h3>
                <p class="skill-row-p">Because I like coding and want to become a software developer I could not ignore JavaScript
                    as one of the most popular languages out there. The fact that it runs in every web browser is awesome.
                </p>
                <p class="skill-row-p">
                    I learned language basics, how JavaScript works behind the scenes, data types, loops and iterations, functions,
                    methods and objects and ES6 features. And I keep on learning.

                <h3 class="skill-row-h3">Python</h3>
                <p class="skill-row-p">I heard about Python when I studied Cisco networking. I read that it was the number one tool for scripting
                    and automation in the networking field and also that it was a good general purpose language and quite
                    easy to start to learn. So I began to pick it up.
                </p>
                <p class="skill-row-p">
                    I learned the syntax ang got nearly to the intermediate level. I gained experience by writing scripts
                    when I worked as a network engineer in Ostrava.
                </p>
                <p class="skill-row-p">
                    I learned all the data types, loops and iteration, methods and functions, OOP, modules and packages, errors and exception handling.
                    I was quite happy to use functions when writing scripts. I didn't need to use much OOP.

                <h3 class="skill-row-h3">Excel - VBA</h3>
                <p class="skill-row-p">I began to use Visual Basic for Applications when I worked as a warehouse clerc or admin as we called it in Manchester, England.
                    I needed to fill several spreadsheets with data regarding the performance of warehouse operatives in our department.
                    But it was very time consuming to calculate everything. So I started to write scripts in VBA to automate the process.
                    I downloaded the performance data in csv format from our warehouse software as usuall. There were several tasks we needed to calculate the results for.
                </p>
                <p class="skill-row-p">I ended up with quite complex script which helped me to calculate performance data for every task and
                    fill it automatically to a table where I could grab it and paste it to the propper spreadsheet for the final report.</p>
